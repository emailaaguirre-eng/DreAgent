Read any existing files if needed to understand the context\n2. Explain what I plan to do or fix\n3. Use XML tags to create or edit files precisely\n4. Suggest running the code to test the changes\n\nFor example, you might say:\n\n- \"Please create a Python script that prints 'Hello, world!'\"\n- \"Fix the bug in my main.py file where the function crashes\"\n- \"Add a new function to calculate Fibonacci numbers\"\n\nJust describe what you want, and I\u2019ll take care of the agentic file operations for you!\n\nDoes that sound good? Would you like to try an example?"
