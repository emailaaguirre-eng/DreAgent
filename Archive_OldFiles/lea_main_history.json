            "content": "Hey Dre,\n\nI can definitely help you with that! However, I don\u2019t have live access to current weather data directly. But I can show you how to get the current weather for Phoenix, AZ programmatically using a weather API.\n\nOne popular choice is the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api).\n\nHere\u2019s a simple Python example using the `requests` library:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\n\ndef get_current_weather(city: str, state: str, country: str = \"US\") -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetch and print the current weather for a specified city.\n    \n    Requires an environment variable OPENWEATHER_API_KEY set with your API key.\n    \"\"\"\n    api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENWEATHER_API_KEY\")\n    if not api_key:\n        print(\"Error: Please set the OPENWEATHER_API_KEY environment variable.\")\n        return\n\n    # Compose location query\n    location = f\"{city},{state},{country}\"\n    \n    url = \"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n    params = {\n        \"q\": location,\n        \"appid\": api_key,\n        \"units\": \"imperial\"  # Use \"metric\" for Celsius\n    }\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses\n        data = response.json()\n\n        weather_description = data[\"weather\"][0][\"description\"]\n        temperature = data[\"main\"][\"temp\"]\n        feels_like = data[\"main\"][\"feels_like\"]\n        humidity = data[\"main\"][\"humidity\"]\n\n        print(f\"Weather in {city}, {state}:\")\n        print(f\"  Description: {weather_description}\")\n        print(f\"  Temperature: {temperature} \u00b0F\")\n        print(f\"  Feels Like: {feels_like} \u00b0F\")\n        print(f\"  Humidity: {humidity}%\")\n\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Network or request error: {e}\")\n    except (KeyError, IndexError) as e:\n        print(f\"Unexpected response format: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_current_weather(\"Phoenix\", \"AZ\")\n```\n\n**How to use this:**\n\n1. Sign up at OpenWeatherMap and get a free API key.\n2. Set an environment variable `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` with that key (`export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key` on Mac/Linux or `setx OPENWEATHER_API_KEY your_key` on Windows).\n3. Run the script. It fetches and prints the current weather in Phoenix.\n\n---\n\nIf you want me to fetch the info directly, just let me know if you prefer a quick API query I can run (within my capabilities) or something else.\n\nDoes this help? Would you like me to also show you how to do this with another service or in another language?"
