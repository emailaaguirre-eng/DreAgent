      "content": "Nice — thanks for confirming, Dre. 🐦 Since this is for work, I’ll route this to Executive Assistant & Operations so they can handle any hands‑on changes (that’s our process for work-related bookkeeping). Before I do that, quick choices so I send them exactly what you want:\n\nPick one:\n1) I’ll route to Executive Assistant & Operations to do the full cleanup (recommended)\n   - What they can do: review recent transactions, create a recommended Chart of Accounts mapping, set Rules to auto-categorize, and bulk‑categorize transactions. They’ll save a short change log and flag anything for your review.\n   - What I’ll include when I route: company name, date range to clean (e.g., last 3 months), whether to update existing rules, list of accounts you want used, any special instructions (e.g., mark vendor X as Advertising), and where to save reports.\n   - I won’t request passwords — they’ll ask you to approve any account access steps if needed.\n\n2) Quick help here first (fast)\n   - Paste 3–5 example transactions (date, vendor, amount, memo) and I’ll tell you the exact category/account to use and any rule you should create. This is just advice — no changes made.\n\n3) Draft a recommended mapping/template\n   - I’ll create a Chart of Accounts mapping tailored to your business type and a list of Rules you should set up. I can include instructions for each Rule and a CSV you can import if you want.\n\nTell me:\n- Do you want me to route to Executive Assistant & Operations now? If yes, confirm the date range to clean (e.g., last 30/90/365 days) and any account preferences or vendors to always categorize a certain way.\n- Or paste a few sample transactions and I’ll categorize them here so you can apply immediately.\n\nWhich do you want me to do? ✅"
